# crostini-dark-theme
A Dark theme for the ChromeOS Linux Container

Just renamed gtk-dark.css to gtk.css, install as you would any other theme (I'll add some instructions here at some point)

Only other thing to say is that this is all Google's work, I assume since it's part of ChromiumOS it's fine to use but if this is bad or illegal or something just let me know and I'll take it down.
